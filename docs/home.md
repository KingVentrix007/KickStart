## What is KickStart

KickStart is a tool designed to streamline the process of starting new coding projects, whether you're working on a side project or developing the next big AI innovation. It automates many of the repetitive tasks required when setting up a project, helping you focus on coding rather than configuration.

With KickStart, you can quickly create the foundational project structure, including all necessary files, folders, and scripts for building and running your code. In addition to this, KickStart simplifies package management across multiple programming languages, even supporting languages without built-in package managers by installing packages from GitHub repositories or Linux commands.
