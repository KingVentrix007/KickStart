## 🚀 What is Kick Start?

**Kick Start** is a lightweight tool that automates boilerplate creation, structure setup, and build script generation for new coding projects — so you can focus on writing code, not configuration.

Whether you're starting in **C, C++, Java, Python, or Rust**, Kick Start gives you a clean, ready-to-run foundation in seconds.

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Multi-Language Templates**  
  Prebuilt templates for **C, C++, Java, Python, Rust**, and more.

- 🛠 **Build Script Generator**  
  Generates `Makefile`, `setup.py`, or batch/shell scripts automatically.

- 📦 **Library Manager**  
  Handles `libs/` folder, fetches dependencies, and tracks them via `.json` metadata.

- 🧱 **Scaffolded Project Structure**  
  Each project includes:
    ```
    /src        → main source file
    /build      → compiled binaries
    libs/       → managed dependencies
    .gitignore
    README.md
    ````

- 📄 **File Headers**  
Author, license, and version comments auto-added to main files.

- 🧠 **Compiler Detection**  
Checks if compilers are installed; provides install links if not.

- 🔌 **Custom Templates & Licenses**  
Easily create and share your own reusable templates.

- 🧰 **Git Integration**  
Auto-inits a Git repo, creates first commit, and links to remotes.

- ⚙ **Config Files**  
- `project.json` — project metadata (portable across GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)  
- `package.json` — Node-style dependencies and metadata
